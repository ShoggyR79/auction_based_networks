#  Author: Aniruddha Gokhale

#
#  Purpose: demonstrate serialization of a user-defined data structure using
#  Protocol Buffers combined with gRPC. Note that here we
#  are more interested in how a serialized packet gets sent over the network
#  and retrieved. To that end, we really don't care even if the client and
#  server were both on the same machine or remote to each other. Thus,
#  to simplify coding, we have mixed both the client and server in the same
#  code so that they run on the same machine. Hence, we term this as a Peer
#  which can don both roles.  When writing code for distributed client and
#  server, just separate the two pieces.
#

# Note that this code mimics what we did with FlatBufs+ZeroMQ but this time
# we mix Protocol Buffers and gRPC

# The different packages we need in this Python driver code
import os
import sys
import time  # needed for timing measurements and sleep

import random  # random number generator
import argparse  # argument parser

from concurrent import futures   # needed for thread pool

import grpc   # for gRPC
